│ User Style: "Prefers detailed explanations with examples"
│ Project State: "React frontend + Python backend"
└───────────────────────────────────────┘

🎯 CONTEXTUAL RESPONSE
Given our previous work on portfolio rebalancing, I can see you'll want 
risk metrics that integrate seamlessly with the existing calculation engine.
Based on your preference for detailed explanations, I'll walk through 
both the mathematical foundations and practical implementation...

[Detailed implementation with memory-informed approach]

💾 MEMORY UPDATE  
┌─ New Learning ─────────────────────┐
│ Success: "User appreciated mathematical background explanation"
│ Pattern: "Risk metrics requests often follow portfolio features"

└───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 🎯 Proactive Memory Application
```
🔮 PREDICTIVE ASSISTANCE
🧠 Memory Analysis: Based on our project history, I notice you typically 
optimize performance after adding new features. Since we just implemented 
the risk metrics dashboard, you might want to consider:

1. Caching strategies for risk calculations
2. Database indexing for historical data queries  
3. Frontend optimization for real-time updates

Would you like me to proactively analyze performance bottlenecks?
